jsJSON-RPC
==========

Hi there, this is JS JsonRPC library, created by me and sometimes by [@S3RK](//github.com/S3RK).  

JsonRPC protocol version is 2.0;  
Always asynchronous and always by POST;

This lib absolutely correspond all [JsonRPC specification requirements](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) (batch, notification, etc.).

Fully documentation is [there](https://github.com/Mtnt/jsonRPC.js/wiki/Documentation).
